                <h3>Steel Design Project </h3>
                <p>One of the projects completed throughout my program at Uoft, developing a preliminary design for an office building. This
                    project drew from our skills learnt throguh our design class as well as the skills for using modeling software. 
                    Following the standards codes like the Handbook of Steel Construction and the National building Code of Canada were essential and different steel sections were selected. 
                </p>
                <h3>Signifigance </h3>
                <p>This team project was a bridge between the more theoretical concepts learnt in the previous years of university to the more realistic world applications. Applying teamwork between different tasks and using software for the previously hand calculated values are all things that are more expected in industry. Using calculators for design checks, creating models in software, and checking for the different load combinations are all relevant to the civil engineering industry. </p>

                <h3>Member Desgin </h3>
                <p>The building was to be built with a combination of moment resisting frames and concentrically braced frames along its two sides. These minute changes had impacts across the SAP model and the different members we chose for each beam and column. From the SAP and the calculated dead and live loads, the first design iteration for the applied loads was performed. The sections in the model were changed and another check was performed for the self weight of the members. Upon reaching satisfaction with design capacity ratios that made the sections both economical and safe, the connection details between the entire structure were designed and modeled in CAD.</p>
                <h3>Connection Design </h3>
                <p> The final part of the project I worked using the design forces to create the connections between the different parts of the structure. This included things like the base plate connection, brace connection, and the beam column connections. These were done in accordance with the standards mentioned above and can be seen below. I detailed drew the sections and details with accordance to the industry standards given. Different things like bolts, welds, and other relevant callouts are shown. </p>

                <img src="f_img/ryoji.jpg">
                <p>
                    This project was an introductory project into the subjects within Traposortaiton Enigneering and Planning. The goal was to choose an issue and create a compelling argument for or against the topic. I choose to look at the idea of automated vehicles and their effects on traffic flow. 
                </p>
                <p>Within 500 words, I look at studies regarding the use and models of automated vehicles and the possible implementation and usage of technology in this field.  </p>
                <p> 
                    Through this I have learnt more about future technology that is coming as well as the benefits and issues that come with it. This allows me to critically analyze future developments in the auto industry as well as develop my research ability, communication, and improving the depths of my knowledge.
